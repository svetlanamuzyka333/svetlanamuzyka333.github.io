<div> <p6> 1.  <u>There is no need to show the dog brute force.</u> Be affectionate and never forget to cheer! </p6> </div> 
<div> <p6> 2.  <u> Long walks in nature (in the woods or in the park) combined with games</u> are a great strengthening of your friendship. Be attentive and remember what places your pet likes. Also, practice games that your dog is particularly responsive to.</p6> </div> 
<div> <p6> 3.  <u>Take your dog to the pet store</u> and give him a few minutes to explore all the options and choose the toy he likes best. He will be grateful for this opportunity.</p6> </div> 
<div> <p6> 4.  <u>Keep calm</u>. If you start yelling or throwing something, your dog will get scared of you and may think that he cannot fully trust you. Dogs are very smart. They will understand that they have upset you and will feel guilty even if you donâ€™t scream and lose your temper.</p6> </div>
